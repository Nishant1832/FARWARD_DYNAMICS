Here I have performed a forward dynamics for a RP robot using ODE45 solver and plot various graph inlcluding force , torque, acceleration , velocity , position.
Here I have used two methods for farword dynamics:-
Free fall - where we took value of force and torque on joint to be zero.
Inverse dynamics - In this method we took the value of force and torque obtained from inverse dynamics of a specific trajectory.
