Here i perform a farword dynamics for a RP robot using ODE45 solver and plot various graph inlcluding force , torque, acceleration , velocity , position.
here I use two methods for farword dynamics:-
free fall - where we take value of force and torque on joint is zero.
inverse dynamics - In this method we take the value of force and torque obtained from inverse dynamics.
